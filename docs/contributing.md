## Contributing

<igia/> is an open-source project and we welcome community involvement and contributions.  Eventually we hope to have a robust community of developers with clear and streamlined processes for contributing back to the core platform.  Until then, please reach out to <img style="position:relative;top:.3em;height:1.2em;" src="/img/info-at-igia-io-black.svg" /> if you are interested in contributing code or packages back to <igia/>.  We welcome your feedback and contributions.
