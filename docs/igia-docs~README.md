# The <span class="igia">igia<span/> public website

This project contains the source of <igia/>'s public website.

## Development

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

### <span class="igia">igia</span> Docs Authoring

<igia/> component documentation inclusion has been automated (see update-content.sh below) via an ansible playbook and configuration.  The playbook pulls the README.md, docs/introduction.md, docs/usage.md, and docs/appendix.md files from each <igia/> component git repository and incorporates the documents as part of the <igia/> docs website.

The ansible/roles/components/tasks/main.yml file contains the main ansible script.  It will delete prior downloaded files then redownload from the project repository group.

The automation script will inject markdown headers into the README file to control the sidebar text and document display titles.  

Component sidebar labels are set in the main.yml file in the vars section, otherwise the sidebar label will be the component repo name.

### Pre-requisites

Ansible requires Python 2.7 or 3.5+, and is installed via pip on macOS.

```
sudo easy_install pip

sudo pip install ansible
```

Other Ansible install options can be found at the [ansible website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip)

### Execute the ansible playbook to rebuild component documentation from component git repositories.

```
./update-content.sh
Private Token: 12345689  <<== enter your private git token here
```

You may also create a .env file in the igia-docs root directory to set the git token permanently for your environment, and you will no longer be prompted.
The .env file is ignored by git.

.env
```
GIT_TOKEN="1234567890"  # put github private access token here, must include API and repo access
```

Or you may simply set GIT_TOKEN environment variable in the shell prior to running ```update-content.sh```
