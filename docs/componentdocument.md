## README.md
Each git repository should have a README.md file in its root directory. The README.md file should contain the following information according to [github.com's guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/):

* What the project does
* Why the project is useful
* How users can get started with the project
* Where users can get help with your project
* Who maintains and contributes to the project

For a <igia/> repository, please start with [<igia/> REAME.md template](templates/README.md).

### Content

* [introduction.md](templates/introduction.md) - Overview of the component
* [usage.md](templates/usage.md) - Detailed configuration and usage of the component
* [appendix.md](templates/appendix.md) - additional materials

The user guide document is created in [docusaurus] (https: //docusaurus.io/en/) format using Markdown language. Please refer to [docusaurus markdown](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/doc-markdown) for docusaurus specific markdown features.
